## Description

This project is an implementation of seamless customer support tool for different websites using the API which retranslates questions of users from the web application to telegram bot connected to Q&A database and volunteer team. Almost all customer-oriented websites nowadays have a tool to ask a question to the Q&A  team, but most of them require team to answer from the website itself, which creates a need to switch platforms if there are different websites.

The main advantage of this tool is its integrability. It can be used for high amount of diverse websites without volunteer team to need to change their messenging platform.
